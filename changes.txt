weewx-rainrate change history
-----------------------------

0.17 Release 2022/12/12
-----------------------
Fix errors mistakenly released in 0.16.

0.16 Release 2022/12/05
-----------------------
1. Completely revamp calculations.  Now the calculation is
   3600 * 0.01 / (now - the time of two tips ago)
   0.02 readings of rain are split with half now and half
   recorded (for purposes of calculating rainrate) as taking
   place halfway in between now and the previous tip.

2. Archive record now reports highest rain rate of the
   archive period.


0.15 Release 2022/12/04
-----------------------
Prior versions of this extension update rain rates in loop packets, but
left archive records untouched.  Archive record rain rates are now
updated to be the average of the rain rate in the loop records for
that archive period.  If there are no loop record rain rates (most likely
because weewx is doing a catchup at startup), the rain rate will be
computed as the total rainfall for this archive period averaged over 15m.

0.14 Release 2022/12/02
-----------------------
Now tested against a significant storm and against a quality non-siphon
tipping bucket (HyQuest Solutions TB7).  Tweaked so that the TB3 (siphone)
resembles the TB7.  Changes are: only use 15 average if 0.01 or 0.02 fell
within last 15m.  Only consider 10 through 15m buckets when 0.03 has
fallen in the last 15m.

0.13 Release 2022/11/18
-----------------------
Min timespan to average now 4m (was 3m).
Buckets are now (back to) 1m (rather than 30s).
Both of these changes were made after considering the paper,
Estimating Rain Rates from Tipping-Bucket Rain Gauge Measurements,
at https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20070016690/downloads/20070016690.pdf
"One-minute rain rates suffer substantial errors, especially at low rain rates.
When one-minute rain rates are averaged to 4 -7 minute scales, the errors
dramatically reduce."

0.12 Release 2022/11/13
-----------------------
Min timespan to average now 3m (was 2m).

0.11 Release 2022/11/11
-----------------------
1. Move to 30s increments, from 1 min. increments, for more responsive rain rate.

0.1 Release 2022/11/10
----------------------
1. Never use the last 60s for rainRate as it is thought to be too noisy.
2. Refactor for testing.
3. Add extensive tests.

0.02 Release 2022/11/09
-----------------------
1. Special case the algorithm for rain rate when low volumes of rain are observed.

0.01 Release 2022/11/08
-----------------------
1. Initial release.
